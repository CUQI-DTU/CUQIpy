class RegularizedUnboundedUniform(RegularizedGaussian):
        """ Implicit Regularized Unbounded Uniform. 

        Defines a so-called implicit prior with implicit regularization on a Gaussian distribution with zero precision.
        The regularization can be defined in the form of a proximal operator or a projector.
        Alternatively, preset constraints and regularization can be used.

        For regularization of the form f(x), provide a single proximal operator.

        Can be used as a prior in a posterior which can be sampled with the RegularizedLinearRTO sampler.

        Alias for :class:`~cuqi.implicitprior.RegularizedGaussian` with zero mean and zero sqrtprec.

        For more details on implicit regularized Gaussian see the following paper:

        Parameters
        ----------
        geometry : :class:`~cuqi.geometry.Geometry` or integer
                The geometry of the underlying variable. Defines the dimension of the distribution. 

        proximal : callable f(x, scale) or None
                Euclidean proximal operator f of the regularization function g, that is, a solver for the optimization problem
                min_z 0.5||x-z||_2^2+scale*g(x).

        projector : callable f(x) or None
                Euclidean projection onto the constraint C, that is, a solver for the optimization problem
                min_(z in C) 0.5||x-z||_2^2.

        constraint : string or None
                Preset constraints. Can be set to "nonnegativity" and "box". Required for use in Gibbs.
                For "box", the following additional parameters can be passed:
                lower_bound : array_like or None
                        Lower bound of box, defaults to zero
                upper_bound : array_like
                        Upper bound of box, defaults to one

        regularization : string or None
                Preset regularization. Can be set to "l1". Required for use in Gibbs in future update.
                For "l1", the following additional parameters can be passed:
                strength : scalar
                        Regularization parameter, i.e., strength*||x||_1 , defaults to one
