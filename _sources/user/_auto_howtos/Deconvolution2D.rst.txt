2D Deconvolution
================

In this example we show how to quantify the uncertainty of a solution to a 2D deconvolution problem.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 8-9

First we import the modules needed.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 9-14

.. code-block:: Python


    import numpy as np
    from cuqi.testproblem import Deconvolution2D
    from cuqi.distribution import Gaussian, LMRF
    from cuqi.problem import BayesianProblem

Step 1: Deterministic model
---------------------------

Consider the deterministic inverse problem

.. math::

  \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}

where :math:`\mathbf{A}` is a matrix representing a 2D convolution operation and
:math:`\mathbf{y}` and :math:`\mathbf{x}` are the data and unknown (solution to the inverse problem) respectively.

A linear forward model like :math:`\mathbf{A}` is represented by a :class:`~cuqi.model.LinearModel`
and any data (like some observed data :math:`\mathbf{y}^\mathrm{obs}`) as a :class:`~cuqi.array.CUQIarray`.

The easiest way to get these two components is to use the built-in testproblems.
Let us extract the model and data for a 2D deconvolution.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-35

.. code-block:: Python


    A, y_obs, info = Deconvolution2D().get_components()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-53

Step 2: Prior model
-------------------

Now we aim to represent our prior knowledge of the unknown image. In this case, let us assume
that the unknown is piecewise constant. This can be modelled by assuming a Laplace difference
prior. The Laplace difference prior can be defined as

.. math::

  \mathbf{x}_{i,j}-\mathbf{x}_{i',j} \sim \mathrm{Laplace}(0, \delta),\\
  \mathbf{x}_{i,j}-\mathbf{x}_{i,j'} \sim \mathrm{Laplace}(0, \delta),

where :math:`\delta` is the scale parameter defining how likely jumps from one pixel value
to another are in the horizontal and vertical directions.

This distribution comes pre-defined in CUQIpy as the :class:`cuqi.distribution.LMRF`.
Notice we have to specify the geometry of the unknown.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-56

.. code-block:: Python


    x = LMRF(location=0, scale=0.1, geometry=A.domain_geometry)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-70

Step 3: Likelihood model
------------------------

Suppose our data is corrupted by a Gaussian noise so our observational model is

.. math::

  \mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}, \sigma^2),

where :math:`\sigma^2` is a noise variance that we know.

We can represent :math:`\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}` as a :class:`cuqi.distribution.Distribution` object.
We often call the distribution of :math:`\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{x}` the data distribution.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-73

.. code-block:: Python


    y = Gaussian(mean=A@x, cov=0.01)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-86

Step 4: Posterior sampling
--------------------------
In actuality we are interested in conditioning on the observed data :math:`\mathbf{y}^\mathrm{obs}`,
to obtain the posterior distribution

.. math::

  p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y}^\mathrm{obs}) \propto p(\mathbf{y}^\mathrm{obs}|\mathbf{x})p(\mathbf{x}),

and then sampling from this posterior distribution.

In CUQIpy, we the easiest way to do this is to use the :class:`cuqi.problem.BayesianProblem` class.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 86-90

.. code-block:: Python


    # Create Bayesian problem and set observed data (conditioning)
    BP = BayesianProblem(y, x).set_data(y=y_obs)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-93

After setting the data, we can sample from the posterior using the :meth:`cuqi.problem.BayesianProblem.sample_posterior`
method. Notice that a well-suited sampler is automatically chosen based on the model, likelihood and prior chosen.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 93-97

.. code-block:: Python


    # Sample posterior
    samples = BP.sample_posterior(200)
