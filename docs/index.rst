CUQIpy's Documentation
======================

Computational Uncertainty Quantification for Inverse Problems in python
(CUQIpy) is a python package for modeling and solving inverse problems
in a Bayesian inference framework. CUQIpy provides a simple high-level
interface to perform UQ analysis of inverse problems, while still
allowing full control of the models and methods. The package comes equipped with a number of predefined distributions,
samplers, models and test problems and is built to be easily further
extended when needed.


This software package is part of the `CUQI
project <https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/cuqi>`__ funded by `the
Villum
Foundation. <https://veluxfoundations.dk/en/forskning/teknisk-og-naturvidenskabelig-forskning>`__
